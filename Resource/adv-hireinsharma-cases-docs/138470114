Ltd. vide settlement agreement dated 24.07.2018 and paid an amount of Rs. 2,32,00,000/- to the lending bank as part of the settlement amount. The said settlement agreement executed between the Petitioner and the lending bank was relied by the Petitioner before the NCLAT. However, the said tribunal refused to withdraw the Insolvency Proceedings against the Company, as there were other financial creditors and a Committee of Creditors had also been constituted by the Interim Resolution Professional. However, several homebuyers including the Complainant filed a Writ Petition before the Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court of India bearing number W.P.(C) 914/2018 and vide its order dated 03.12.2018, Bail Appln.3023/2019  of 10 disposed of the said Writ Petition in view of an out of Court Settlement being entered into between the petitioners therein and the Company.

Learned APP further submits that during the course of investigation, some of the victims have been examined and their statement have been recorded and notices under section 41A Cr.P.C. were issued to alleged person namely Bijender Singh Lather, petitioner herein, including Joginder Singh Lather, Ram Niwas, Sajjan Singh Beniwal and Bhawana Lather, to which the petitioner joined the investigation but he has not provided any specific information which may help the investigation to get the trail of the investment of the complainant and tried to shift the liabilities to other directors. Therefore, custodial interrogation of the petitioner/accused is required for the following reasons:- 
Investigation of the case is at initial stage. 
Accused did not provide any relevant documents showing utilisation of investment of complainant on proposed project. 
To unearth the conspiracy hatched by the accused persons and his associates. 
To recover the cheated amount and to trace the money trail. 
To decide the role of other persons/company, who are the beneficiaries of the cheated amount as per bank account statement Bail Appln.3023/2019  of 10 of alleged company. 
Keeping in view the serious allegations mentioned above against the petitioner, who has played key role in the present case and due to the material documents which are required to be seized from the petitioner, for which custodial interrogation is required, therefore, I am not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petition is dismissed. 
Pending applications also stands disposed of.
